            <h2>About Drake</h2>
            <p>As an entrepreneur, Drake founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40 in 2012. In
                2013, Drake became the new "global ambassador" of the Toronto Raptors, joining the executive committee
                of the NBA franchise, while owning naming rights to its practice facility. In 2016, he began
                collaborating with American entrepreneur Brent Hocking on the bourbon whiskey Virginia Black; it
                eventually broke sale records in Canada.[15] Drake has also designed fashion, the most notable including
                a sub-label collaboration with Nike, alongside other business ventures. In 2018, he was reportedly
                responsible for 5% (CAD$440 million) of Toronto's CAD$8.8 billion total annual tourism income.[16]</p>
